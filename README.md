üöÄ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 17 or higher.

Maven: For building and managing project dependencies.

MySQL Server: A running MySQL database instance.

OMDB API Key: Obtain a free API key from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx.

Database Setup
Create Database: Create a new database named watchmovie in your MySQL server.

CREATE DATABASE watchmovie;



Configure application.properties:
Open src/main/resources/application.properties and update the database connection details and your OMDB API key:

# Database Connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/watchmovie
spring.datasource.username=root # Your MySQL username
spring.datasource.password=ashu122112 # Your MySQL password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# JPA/Hibernate Configuration
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Use 'update' for development, 'none' for production

# OMDB API Key (replace with your actual key)
# Ensure this is correctly set in your RatingService.java as well if hardcoded there
# (e.g., in RatingService.java: String apiUrl="https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY&t=";)



Note: For spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto, update is suitable for development as it will create/update tables automatically without dropping data. For production, consider none and manage schema migrations manually.

Initial Role Data (Optional but Recommended):
Spring Security expects roles to exist. You might need to manually insert the ROLE_USER role into your roles table if your application doesn't automatically populate it on first run (which it should if ddl-auto is create or create-drop initially).

INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('ROLE_USER');



Running the Application
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/watchlist-app.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd watchlist-app



Build the project:

mvn clean install



Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run



The application will start on http://localhost:8080.

Troubleshooting
"Add a README" still showing on GitHub: If you've pushed the README.md file but GitHub still prompts you to add one, ensure the README.md file is located directly in the root directory of your repository, not inside a subfolder. Sometimes, a browser cache refresh (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R) might also be needed.

üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Register: Click on the "Register" link to create a new user account. After successful registration, you will be redirected to the login page.

Login: Use your newly created credentials to log in.

Manage Watchlist:

Add New Movie: Click "Add Item" in the navigation bar to open the movie submission form. Enter the movie title, priority (L/M/H), and comments. The IMDb rating will be fetched automatically if available, or you can enter it manually.

View Watchlist: Go to the "Watchlist" page to see all your added movies.

Update Movie: Click "Update" next to a movie entry to modify its details.

Delete Movie: Click "Delete" next to a movie entry. A confirmation modal will appear before deletion.
